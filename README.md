# Good README Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

When building a project on github, a README is always required to explain the project and what it can be used for. However, it can be difficult to write a professional README file. To help create the best README possible, users can use this program. It takes user input for all of the sections required for a professional README, then generates a product containing a README.md and a LICENSE of the user's choosing. 

By creating this project, I learned to use Node.js to run the required program. I also learned how to use different Node Modules to allow my program to do what I needed it to.
